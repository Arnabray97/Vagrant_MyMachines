    # Box for CentOS Stream (replace with appropriate box name for your desired version)
    # You can find available boxes on Vagrant Cloud: https://app.vagrantup.com/boxes/search
    # For CentOS Stream 9:
    config.vm.box = "centos/stream9"
    # For CentOS Stream 8:
    #config.vm.box = "centos/stream8"  # Or "centos/stream9" if you prefer the latest.
    # For a specific version (e.g., CentOS Stream 9 latest):
    # config.vm.box = "centos/stream9"
    # config.vm.box_version = ">= 20231026" # Example date, adjust as needed.
  
    #config.vm.box_allow_insecure = true # Only needed if you have issues with box verification.  Generally avoid unless you have a specific reason.
  
    config.vm.hostname = "centos-stream-vm" # Set the hostname of the VM
  
    # Networking (choose one of the options below)
    # 1. Bridged networking (connects the VM directly to your network)
    # config.vm.network "bridged"
  
    # 2. Host-only networking (creates a private network between the host and the VM)
    config.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.56.15" # Example IP address

    # Create a public network, which generally matched to bridged network.
    # Bridged networks make the machine appear as another physical device on
    # your network.
    config.vm.network "public_network"
  
    # 3. NAT networking (default; the VM can access the internet, but is not directly accessible from the host)
    # No explicit configuration needed for NAT as it's the default.  Port forwarding is common with NAT.  Example:
    # config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 80, host: 8080 # Forward port 80 in the VM to 8080 on the host
  
    # Synced folders (share files between the host and the VM)
    #config.vm.synced_folder ".", "/vagrant", :type => "rsync" # Share the current directory with /vagrant in the VM.  Rsync is recommended for performance.
  
    # Provisioning (run commands or scripts inside the VM after it's started)
    # Example: Install updates and some packages
    # config.vm.provision "shell", inline: <<-SHELL
    #   yum update -y
    #   yum install -y nano vim wget curl net-tools
    # SHELL
  
    # Customize resources (memory, CPU)
    config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
      vb.memory = "2048" # 2GB of RAM
      vb.cpus = 2       # 2 CPUs
    end
  
    # Optional: Customize the GUI
    # config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
    #   vb.gui = true
    # end
